<h2>FORE-SAY.</h2>


<p>This little book was not written to win prize or praise;
but it is put forth as one small trial, weak though it may
be, towards the upholding of our own strong old Anglo-Saxon
speech, and the ready teaching of it to purely
English minds by their own tongue.</p>

<p>Speech was shapen of the breath-sounds of speakers,
for the ears of hearers, and not from speech-tokens
(letters) in books, for men’s eyes, though it is a great
happiness that the words of man can be long holden and
given over to the sight; and therefore I have shapen
my teaching as that of a speech of breath-sounded
words, and not of lettered ones; and though I have, of
course, given my thoughts in a book, for those whom
my voice cannot reach, I believe that the teaching
matter of it may all be put forth to a learner’s mind, and
readily understood by him, without book or letters. So,
for consonants and vowels, as letters, I put breath-pennings
and free-breathings, and these names would be
good for any speech, of the lettering of which a learner
might know nothing. On the grounds here given, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_a004" id="Page_a004">[iv]</a></span>
have not begun with <i>orthography</i>, the writing or spelling
of our speech, or of any other, while as yet the teaching
or learning of the speech itself is unbegun.</p>

<p>I have tried to teach English by English, and so have
given English words for most of the lore-words (scientific
terms), as I believe they would be more readily and more
clearly understood, and, since we can better keep in
mind what we do than what we do not understand, they
would be better remembered. There is, in the learning
of that charmingly simple and yet clear speech, pure
Persian, now much mingled with Arabic, a saddening
check; for no sooner does a learner come to the time-words
than he is told that he should learn, what is then
put before him, an outline of Arabic Grammar. And there
are tokens that, ere long, the English youth will want an
outline of the Greek and Latin tongues ere he can well
understand his own speech.</p>

<p>The word <i>grammar</i> itself seems a misused word, for
<i>grapho</i> is to write, and <i>graphma</i>, worn into <i>gramma</i>,
means a writing, and the word <i>grammatikē</i> meant, with
the Greeks, booklore or literature in the main, and not
speech-teaching alone.</p>

<p>Whether my lore-words are well-chosen is a question
for the reader’s mind. I have, for better or worse, treated
the time-words, and nearly all the parts of speech, in a
new way. I have clustered up the time-words as weak
or strong on their endings, rather than on their headings,
which had nothing to do with their forshapening or conjugation.
Case I have taken as in the thing, and not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_a005" id="Page_a005">[v]</a></span>
the name of it, as case is the case into which a thing
falls with a time-taking, and case-words (prepositions)
and case-endings are the tokens of their cases. The
word <i>preposition</i> means a foreputting, or word put before;
but then <i>from</i> and <i>to</i>, in <i>herefrom</i>, and <i>therefrom</i>, and
<i>hitherto</i>, and <i>thereto</i>, are postpositions.</p>

<p>I have tried, as I have given some so-thought truths
of English speech, to give the causes of them, and hope
that the little book may afford a few glimpses of new insight
into our fine old Anglo-Saxon tongue.</p>

<p>To any friend who has ever asked me whether I
do not know some other tongues beside English, my
answer has been ‘No; I do not know English itself.’
How many men do? And how should I know all of the
older English, and the mighty wealth of English words
which the English Dialect Society have begun to bring
forth; words that are not all of them other shapes of our
words of book-English, or words of their very meanings,
but words of meanings which dictionaries of book-English
should, but cannot give, and words which should be
taken in hundreds (by careful choice) into our Queen’s
English? If a man would walk with me through our
village, I could show him many things of which we want
to speak every day, and for which we have words of
which Johnson knew nothing.</p>

<p>Some have spoken of cultivated languages as differing
from uncultivated ones, and of the reducing of a
speech to a grammatical form.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of ‘cultivate’ as a time word about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_a006" id="Page_a006">[vi]</a></span>
a speech? The Latin dictionary does not help us to its
meaning, and it might be that of the French <i>cultiver</i>, from
which we should have, by the wonted changes, to <i>cultive</i>.
The Romans said <i>colere deum</i> and <i>colere agrum</i>, but not
<i>agrum cultivare</i>; and we may believe that <i>colo</i>, with <i>deus</i>
or <i>ager</i>, bore the same meaning, ‘to keep or hold (with
good care),’ and a speech is cultivated by the speaking as
well as by the writing of it, and a speech which is sounding
over a whole folkland every moment of the day cannot
be uncultivated. ‘Not with good care,’ it may be said.
Yes; most people speak as well as they can, as they write
as well as they can, from the utterer of a fine rede-speech
(oration), and the clergyman who gives unwritten sermons,
down to the lowly maiden who dresses as finely as
she can; and to try to dress herself well is a token that
she will try to express herself well.</p>

<p>King Finow, of the Tonga Islands, gave a fine speech,
as Mr. Mariner tells us, at his coming to the throne; and
it may be well said that he made it, as he had made it in
thought, ere he came to the meeting.</p>

<p>What is meant by the reducing of a speech to a
grammatical form, or to grammar, is not very clear. If a
man would write a grammar of a speech, of which there
is yet none, what could he do but show it forth as it is in
the shape which its best speakers over the land hold to
be its best? To hold that a tongue had no shape, or a
bad one, ere a grammar of it was written, seems much
like saying that a man had no face, or a bad one, till his
likeness was taken.</p>

<h2>SPEECH-CRAFT.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Speech-craft</span> (Grammar), called by our Saxon fore-fathers
<i>Staef-craeft</i> or <i>Letter-craft</i>, is the knowledge or
skill of a speech.</p>

<p>The science of speech in the main, as offmarked
from any one speech (Philology), may be called <i>Speech-lore</i>.</p>

<p>Speech is the speaking or bewording of thoughts, and
is of sundry kinds of words.</p>

<p>Speech is of breath-sounds with sundry breathings,
hard or mild, and breath-pennings, which become words.</p>

<p>(1) A freely open breathing through the throat,
unpent by tongue or lips, as in the sounds <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>O</b>, <b>OO</b>,
which are pure voicing. The main ones in English
are&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>1. <b>ee</b>, in <i>meet</i>.</li>
<li>2. <b>e</b>, in Dorset speech.</li>
<li>3. <b>a</b>, in <i>mate</i>.</li>
<li>4. <b>ea</b>, in <i>earth</i>.</li>
<li>5. <b>a</b>, in <i>father</i>.</li>
<li>6. <b>aw</b>, in <i>awe</i>.</li>
<li>7. <b>o</b>, in <i>bone</i>.</li>
<li>8. <b>oo</b>, in <i>fool</i>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Besides this open speech-breathing there are two
kinds of breath-penning.</p>

<p>(2) The dead breath-penning, as in the sounds <b>AK</b>,
<b>AP</b>, <b>AT</b>, <b>AG</b>, <b>AB</b>, <b>AD</b>, which end with a dead penning
of the sounding breath.</p>

<p>In <b>AK</b> and <b>AG</b> it is pent in the throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>In <b>AP</b> and <b>AB</b> with the lips.</p>

<p>In <b>AT</b> and <b>AD</b> on the roof.</p>

<p><b>K</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>T</b> are hard pennings; <b>G</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>D</b> are mild pennings,
the breathing being harder in the former and
softer in the latter.</p>

<p>Then there are half-pennings of the sounding breath,
which is more or less but not wholly pent, but allowed
to flow on as through the nose in</p>

<ul>
<li><b>AMH</b>,</li>
<li><b>ANH</b>,</li>
<li><b>AM</b>,</li>
<li><b>AN</b>,</li>
<li><b>ANG</b>;</li>
</ul>


<p>as in the half-pent sounds&mdash;</p>


<div class="lefttable">
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p>Words are of breath-sounds, and some words are
one-sounded, as <i>man</i>; and others are tway-sounded, as
<i>manly</i>; and others many-sounded, as <i>unmanliness</i>.</p>

<p>There is word-strain and speech-strain.</p>

<p>The high word-strain (accent) is the rising or strengthening
of the voice on one sound of a word, as <i>man´ly</i>.</p>

<p>The high speech-strain (emphasis) is the rising or
strengthening of the voice on a word of a thought-wording.</p>

<p>The voice may both rise and fall on the same sounds,
as <i>nō</i>.</p>

<p>In English and its Teutonic sister speeches the strain
keeps on the root or stem-word, as <i>man</i>, <i>man´ly</i>,
<i>man´liness</i>; though in clustered words, with their first
breath-sounds the same, the strain may shift for the sake
of clearness, as ‘Give me the <i>tea</i>´pot’&mdash;the tea<i>kettle</i> is
given, and thereupon the bidder may say ‘the tea<span class="smcap lowercase">POT</span>´,’
not the tea<span class="smcap lowercase">KETTLE</span>.</p>

<p>In Greek the accent shifts in word-building, and
likes mainly to settle at about two times or short breath-sounds
from the end of the word; and in Welsh it
settles mostly on the last breath-sound but one, as
<i>eis´tedd</i>, a sitting; <i>eistedd´fod</i>, a sitting-stead; <i>eisteddfod´an</i>,
sitting-steads, or bardic sessions.</p>

<p>Besides the word-strain (accent) and the speech-strain
(emphasis), there is a speech-tuning (modulation)
of the voice (voice-winding), which winds up or down
with sundry feelings of the mind, and with question
and answers and changes of the matter of speech.</p>

<p>Things may be <i>matterly</i> (concrete) or bodies of
matter, as a <i>man</i>, a <i>tree</i>, a <i>stone</i>; or</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Things may be <i>unmatterly</i> (abstract), not bodies of
matter, as <i>faith</i>, <i>hope</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>shape</i>, <i>speed</i>, <i>emptiness</i>.</p>

<p>It is not altogether good that a matterly and unmatterly
thing should be named by the very same word,
as <i>youth</i>, a young man, and <i>youth</i>, youngness.</p>


<h3>THINGS AND THING-NAMES.</h3>

<p>Things are of many kinds, as a <i>man</i>, a <i>bird</i>, a <i>fish</i>;

<p>The names of things may be called <span class="smcap">Thing-names</span>.</p>

<p>But there are one-head thing-names (proper names),
the names each of some one thing of its kind; as <i>John</i>,
the miller; <i>Toby</i>, the dog; <i>Moti</i>, the lady’s Persian
cat.</p>

<p>With Christian names may be ranked the so-called
<i>patronymics</i>, or <i>sire-names</i>, taken from a father’s name, as
William <i>Johnson</i>, Thomas <i>Richardson</i>; or in Welsh,
Enid Verch <i>Edeyrn</i>; or in Hebrew Jeroboam <i>Ben-nebat</i>.</p>


<h4>Thing Sundriness and Thing Mark-words.</h4>

<p>☛ <i>Mark</i> is here to be taken in its old Saxon
meaning, <i>mearc</i>&mdash;what bounds, defines, describes, distinguishes.</p>

<p>The Welsh call the adjective the <i>weak name</i> or noun,
<i>enw gwan</i>.</p>

<p>We use <i>a</i> before a consonant, and <i>an</i> before a vowel,
as <i>a</i> man, <i>an</i> awl. But it is not that we have put on
the <i>n</i> to <i>a</i> against the yawning, but it is that the <i>n</i> has
been worn off from <i>an</i>.</p>

<p>The Frieses and Holsteiners now say <i>ien man</i> and
<i>en mann</i>.</p>

<p>The mark-word <i>an</i>, <i>a</i> is of use to offmark a common
one-head name, as ‘I have been to <i>a white church</i>’
(common); or, without the mark-word, ‘I have been to
<i>Whitechurch</i>’ (one-head), the name of a village so called.
‘He lives by <i>a pool</i>’; ‘he lives by <i>Pool</i>’ (a town in
Dorset). ‘He works in <i>a broad mead</i>’; ‘he works in
<i>Broadmead</i>’ (in Bristol).</p>

<p>As the Welsh has no such mark-word, it might be
thought that it cannot give these two sundry meanings;
and the way in which it can offmark them shows how
idle it is to try one tongue only by another, or to talk of
the unmeaningness or uselessness of the Welsh word
moulding.</p>

<p><i>Llan-Tydno</i> would mean <i>a church of Tydno</i>, but
the parish called ‘The Church of Tydno’ is in Welsh
<i>Llandydno</i>, which, as a welding of two words, hints to
the Welsh mind that <i>Llandydno</i> is a proper name, and so
that of a parish.</p>

<p><i>Hoel da</i> would mean <i>a good Hoel</i>; but to Hoel, the
good king, the Welsh gives as a welded proper name
<i>Hoel dda</i>; and to <i>Julius Cæsar</i> the Welsh gives, as one
welded proper name, <i>Iolo-voel</i>, Julius-bald, whereas <i>Iolo-moel</i>
would mean some bald Julius.</p>

<p>When the singular shape ends in <i><span class="locked">-sh</span></i>, <i><span class="locked">-ss</span></i>, or <i><span class="locked">-x</span></i>, <i><span class="locked">-ks</span></i>, it
takes on <i><span class="locked">-es</span></i> for the somely, as <i>lash</i>, <i>lashes</i>; <i>kiss</i>, <i>kisses</i>;
<i>box</i>, <i>boxes</i>.</p>

<p>And surely, when the singular shape ends in <i><span class="locked">-st</span></i>, our
Universities or some high school of speech ought to give
us leave to make it somely by the old ending -<i>en</i> or
<i><span class="locked">-es</span></i> instead of <i><span class="locked">-s</span></i>&mdash;<i>fist</i>, <i>fisten</i>, <i>fistes</i>; <i>nest</i>, <i>nesten</i>, <i>nestes</i>.</p>

<p>What in the world of speech can be harsher than
<i>fists</i>, <i>lists</i>, <i>nests</i>?</p>

<p>It is unhappy that the old ending in <i><span class="locked">-en</span></i>, which is
yet the main one in West Friesic, should have given
way to the hissing <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>Where common names with the definite mark-word
become names of places they are wont to lose the
article, as <i>The Bath</i>, in Somerset, is now <i>Bath</i>; <i>The
Wells</i>, in Somerset, <i>Wells</i>; <i>Sevenoaks</i>, not <i>The Seven Oaks</i>,
in Kent.</p>

<p>In our version of Acts xxvii. 8, we have a place
which is called <i>The Fair Havens</i>, instead of <i>Fairhavens</i>
without the mark-word, as the Greek gives the name.</p>

<p>Other thing mark-words offmark all of the things of
a name or set from others of another name or set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>All</i> birds, or <i>all</i> the birds in the wood; or all taken
singly, as <i>each</i> or <i>every</i> bird; or somely, as <i>set</i> or <i>share</i>;
<i>some few</i> or <i>a few</i>; <i>many</i> or <i>a many</i> birds.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> or <i>others</i> beyond one or some under speech.</p>

<p><i>Any one</i> or <i>more</i> of a some, either apple or any
apples.</p>

<p><i>Both</i>, for the two without others; or</p>

<p><i>Much</i> or <i>little</i> grass.</p>

<p>Many mark-words were at first thing-names.</p>

<p><i>Many</i> was a <i>menge</i>, a main or upmingled set; and a
great many men would mean a great set or gathering of
men.</p>

<p><i>Few</i> was <i>feo</i>, which seems to have meant at first a
cluster or herd; and a few men was a few (cluster) of
men.</p>

<p><i>Some</i> was a <i>sam</i> or <i>som</i>, a set or upmingled mass;
and <i>some</i> men was a <i>sam</i> or <i>som</i> of men.</p>

<p>Now if the speech is about the set, it may be
onely, as ‘There <i>is</i> a great many,’ ‘there <i>is</i> a small few,’ or
‘a few’; but if the speech is about the bemarked things,
the mark-word may well be somely&mdash;‘many men <i>are</i>’;
‘few men <i>are</i>’; ‘some men <i>are</i>.’</p>

<p>In the queer wording, ‘many a man,’ ‘many a
flow’r is born to blush unseen,’ it is not at all likely
that <i>a</i> is the article. It is rather a worn shape, like <i>a</i>
in <i>a-mong</i> (an-menge), or <i>a-hunting</i> (an-huntunge), of the
Saxon case-word <i>an</i> or <i>on</i>, meaning <i>in</i>; and it is not
unlikely that <i>man</i> has, by the mistaking of <i>a</i> for an
article, taken the stead of <i>men</i>&mdash;‘an maeng an men,’
a many or mass in men; as we say ‘a herd in sheep,’
‘a horde in gold.’ So far as this is true the mark-word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
may be somely&mdash;‘many a man or men,’ ‘a main in men
<i>are</i>.’</p>

<p><i>None</i> (Saxon <i>na-an</i>, no one) should have a singular
verb&mdash;‘None <i>is</i> (not <i>are</i>) always happy.’</p>

<p>Some mark-words are for a clear outmarking (as single
or somely) of things outshown from among others.</p>

<p>The so-called definite article <i>the</i> is a mark-word of
the same kind as <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>these</i>, and <i>those</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>the</i> in ‘the more the merrier’ is not the
article <i>the</i>&mdash;to a name-word. It is an old Saxon outshowing
mark-word meaning with that (<i>mid þy</i>). ‘The
more the merrier’; <i>þy</i> (with that measure), they are
more; <i>þy</i> (with that measure), they are merrier.</p>

<p>In the wording ‘the man <i>who</i>’ or ‘the bird <i>which</i>
was in the garden,’ <i>who</i> and <i>which</i> are not the names,
but are tokens or mark-words of the things&mdash;<i>who</i> of the
<i>man</i>, and <i>which</i> of the <i>bird</i>.</p>

<p>A thing may be marked by many mark-words, as
‘the (never to be forgotten) day,’ ‘the (having to me
shown so many kindnesses) man is yet alive.’</p>

<p>A long string of mark-words may, however, be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
awkward, and so we may take a name-token <i>who</i> for the
<i>man</i>, and, instead of the words ‘having to me shown
so many kindnesses,’ say, ‘who showed me so many
kindnesses.’</p>

<p><i>Who</i> or <i>that</i> is the name-token for menkind, and
<i>which</i> or <i>that</i> for beings of lower life or of no life, as
‘the man <i>who</i>’ or ‘the bird or flower <i>which</i> was in
the garden.’</p>

<p><i>Who</i> and <i>which</i> are used in the asking of questions&mdash;‘<i>Who</i>
is he?’ ‘<i>What</i> is that?’</p>

<p>The name-token should follow close on the forename
for the sake of clearness. ‘Alfred sold, for a
shilling, the <i>bat which</i> William gave him,’ not ‘Alfred
sold the bat for a <i>shilling which</i> William gave him,’ if it
was the <i>bat</i> that was given to him by William.</p>

<p>These mark-words take the stead of thing-names,
and are <i>Name-stead words</i>, and clear the speech of
repetitions of the names. The baby may say ‘Baby
wants the doll,’ but at length learns to say ‘<i>I</i> want
the doll’; or ‘<i>Papa</i>, take <i>baby</i>,’ and afterwards ‘<i>You</i>
take <i>me</i>’; or ‘Give <i>baby</i> the <i>whip</i>&mdash;the <i>whip</i> is <i>baby’s</i>,’
for ‘<i>It</i> is <i>mine</i>.’</p>

<p>A man may be beholden to the speech in three
ways:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>(1) He may be the speaker, called the First Person;</li>

<li>(2) He may be spoken to, the Second Person (the to-spoken thing);</li>

<li>(3) He may be spoken of, the Third Person (the of-spoken thing);</li></ul>


<p>and some mark-words are for the marking of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
without their names, both in tale and their sundry beholdenness
to the speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here the sex is marked.</p>

<p><i>It</i> is sometimes put for an unforeset thing-name of
an unbodily cause or might, as ‘<i>it</i> rains’; ‘<i>it</i> freezes.’</p>

<p>For a child or an animal of unknown sex we may
take the neuter (or sexless) mark-word <i>it</i>. ‘<i>It</i> (the child)
cries.’</p>


<h3>SUCHNESS OR QUALITIES,</h3>

<p>and mark-words or mark-wording of suchness, as <i>good</i>,
<i>bad</i>, <i>long</i>, <i>heavy</i>.</p>

<p>Suchness may be marked by one word, as ‘a <i>white</i> lily,’
or by a some or many of words, as ‘a <i>very white</i> lily,’
or ‘a <i>most dazzlingly white</i> lily,’ or ‘a lily as <i>white as
snow</i>.’</p>

<p>Things are marked as having much of something, as
<i>hilly</i>, <i>stony</i>, <i>watery</i>; or made of something, as <i>golden</i>,
<i>wooden</i>, <i>woollen</i>; or having some things, as <i>two-legged</i>,
<i>three-cornered</i>, <i>long-eared</i>, or <i>loved</i> or <i>hated</i>; of the same
set or likeness of something, as <i>lovely</i>, <i>quarrelsome</i>,
<i>manly</i>, <i>childish</i>; wanting of something, as <i>beardless</i>,
<i>friendless</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<h4>Pitches of Suchness.</h4>

<p>The Suchnesses of Things are of sundry pitches,
which are marked by sundry shapes or endings or bye-words
of the mark-words, as ‘My ash is <i>tall</i>, the elm is
<i>taller</i>, and the Lombardy poplar is the <i>tallest</i> of the
three trees’; or ‘Snow is <i>whiter</i> than chalk,’ or ‘Chalk
is <i>less white</i> than snow,’ or ‘John is the <i>tallest</i> or <i>least
tall</i> of the three brothers.’</p>

<p>These Pitch-marks offmark sundry things by their
sundry suchnesses, as ‘The <i>taller</i> or <i>less tall</i> man of the
two is my friend,’ or ‘The <i>tallest</i> man is <i>less tall</i> than
the tree,’ or ‘The <i>least tall</i> man is <i>taller</i> than the girl.’</p>

<p>The three Pitches may be called the <i>Common Pitch</i>,
the <i>Higher Pitch</i>, and the <i>Highest Pitch</i>.</p>

<p>The Welsh has a fourth Pitch-word, called the
<i>Even Pitch</i>, as <i>pell</i>, far; <i>pellach</i>, farther; <i>pellaf</i>, farthest;
<i>pelled</i>, as far (as something else).</p>

<p><i>Younger</i> may mean <i>younger</i> reckoned from young, or
<i>younger</i> reckoned from <i>old</i>; as ‘Alfred at 80 is younger
than Edward at 85.’ In this case we may well say
<i>less old</i>.</p>

<p><i>Worse</i> (wyrse) is shapen from <i>wo</i>, <i>wa</i>, <i>we</i>, a stub-root
which means <i>wrong</i>, <i>atwist</i>, <i>bad</i> in any way, and is our
<i>woe</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>r</i> in <i>weor</i> is most likely of a forstrengthening
and not a comparative meaning&mdash;<i>weor</i>, <i>wyr</i>, very bad;
<i>weorer</i>, <i>wyrer</i>, still more strongly bad. But, not to
double the <i>r</i>, men might have put a strengthening <i>s</i>,
and so had <i>weors</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<h3>TIME-TAKING.</h3>

<p>You cannot behold a thing in your mind otherwise
than in or under some doing or in some form of being.</p>

<p>Every case of being or doing is a taking of time,
as ‘the lily <i>is</i> white,’ ‘the man <i>strikes</i>,’ ‘the bird <i>flies</i>
or <i>was hit</i>.’ For though the <i>being</i> white, or the <i>striking</i>
or <i>flying</i> or <i>hitting</i> was only for the twinkling of an eye,
it took time; for the eyelid takes time, however short it
may be, to flit down and up over the eyeball. Thence
the word commonly called the <i>verb</i> may be called the
<i>Time-taking word</i> or <i>Time-word</i>, as it is called by the
Germans <i>Das Zeitwort</i>; or, as it is the main word of the
thought and speech, it is the <i>Thought-word</i> or <i>Speech-word</i>;
or, as it is called in Latin and other tongues, the
<i>Word</i>.</p>

<p>Welsh speech-lore has called the verb the <i>soul</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of
the thought-wording.</p>

<p>Among the thousands of sundriness of time-taking
there are some wide differences which should be borne
in mind.</p>


<h4>Unoutreaching or Intransitive.</h4>

<p>Time-takings, which must or may end with the time-taking
thing, as</p>

<p><i>To be.</i> John cannot <i>be</i> another man.</p>

<p><i>To sleep</i>; <i>to walk</i>. John cannot <i>sleep</i> or <i>walk</i>
another man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<h4>Outreaching (Transitive).</h4>

<p>Time-takings that may begin with the time-taking
thing, and reach out to another, as</p>

<p><i>To strike</i>; <i>to see</i>. John may <i>strike</i> or <i>see</i> another
man.</p>


<h4>Time-giving.</h4>

<p>If a man, A, takes time against another, B, as <i>to see</i>
B, we should more truly say of B that he <i>gives</i>, not <i>takes</i>,
the time which A takes.</p>

<p>The time-words for unoutreaching time-takings may
be called <i>Unoutreaching</i>; of the outreaching ones, <i>Outreaching</i>;
of the time-givings, <i>Time-giving</i>.</p>

<p>In some cases there is between the time-taking thing
and the time-giving thing a middle one&mdash;the thing, tool, or
matter with which the time is taken, as ‘John hit William
<i>with</i> a stone’ or ‘a cane.’ But then, again, this wording
is shortened by the putting of the name of the mid-thing
as a time-word, as ‘John <i>stoned</i> or <i>caned</i> William.’
And this brings in a call for the marking of two sundry
kinds of time-words&mdash;the strong or moulded, and weak
or unmoulded time-words.</p>

<p>A time-word, when it tells a taking of time by one
thing against another, is in the outreaching (active)
<i>voice</i>&mdash;‘John strikes the iron.’ When it tells of the
giving of time, it is in the time-giving (passive) <i>voice</i>.
When it tells of an unoutreaching time-taking it is in
the middle <i>voice</i>.</p>

<p>For the causing of another thing to take time some
tongues have set shapes of the time-word, as, in Hindustani,
<i>durna</i>, to run; <i>durāna</i>, to make another run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>We have hardly any of such words, though such are&mdash;</p>


<ul>
<li>Lie, lay.</li>
<li>Sit, set.</li>
<li>Rise, raise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time-takings for becoming or making another thing
become otherwise are marked by the ending <i><span class="locked">-en</span></i> on the
mark-word, as</p>

<ul>
<li>To blacken.</li>
<li>To whiten.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Misdoing</i> by the fore-eking <i>mis-</i>:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Mistake.</li>
<li>Misread.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Longer-lasting time-takings</i> marked by the ending

<p>A time-taking, taken as a deed or being without any
time-taking thing, is taken as a <i>thing</i>, and its name is
a <i>Thing-name</i>, as <i>to write</i>.</p>

<p>As in Greek the Infinitive mood, <i>tò gráphein</i>, the
‘to write’; and in Italian, <i>il scrivere</i>, the ‘to write’ (the
deed of writing or a writing), so the Infinitive mood-shape
of the Saxon time-word was taken as a thing-name
after the preposition <i>to</i>, to or for, as <i>to huntianne</i> (to
or for the deed to hunt or hunting), as ‘Why does
Alfred keep those dogs?’ ‘To huntianne.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Thence we have our wording&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>‘Any chairs <i>to mend</i>?’ (any chairs to or for the deed mending),</li>
<li>‘A house <i>to let</i>,’</li>
<li>‘Letters <i>to write</i>,’</li>
<li>‘A tale <i>to tell</i>,’</li></ul>

<p>which is all good English.</p>

<p>It is an evil to our speech that the thing-shape now
ending in <i><span class="locked">-ing</span></i> should be mistaken for the mark-word
ending in <i><span class="locked">-ing</span></i>.</p>

<p>Unhappily two sundry endings of the old English
have worn into one shape. They were <i><span class="locked">-ung</span></i> or <i><span class="locked">-ing</span></i>
and <i><span class="locked">-end</span></i>.</p>

<p><i>Singung</i> is the deed of singing, a thing. <i>Singend</i> is
a mark-word, as in the wording ‘I have a <i>singing</i> bird.’</p>

<p><i>Sailing</i> and <i>hunting</i>, in the foregiven thought-wordings,
are thing-names, and not mark-words. <i>Sailing</i> is <i>segling</i>,
as ‘ne mid <i>seglinge</i> ne mid rownesse’ (neither with sailing
nor rowing).&mdash;Bede 5, 1.</p>

<p>‘<i>Wunigende</i> ofer hyne’ (<i>woning</i> [mark-word] over
him).&mdash;Matt iii. 16.</p>

<p>‘Sy <i>wunung</i> heora on west’ (be their <i>woning</i> [thing-name]
waste).&mdash;Ps. lxviii 30.</p>

<p>‘Ða genealaehton hym to Farisaer hyne <i>costigende</i>’
(then came near to him the Pharisees <i>tempting</i> [mark-word]
him).&mdash;Matt xix. 3.</p>

<p>‘Ne gelaede þu us on <i>costnunge</i>’ (lead us not into
<i>tempting</i> [thing-name]).&mdash;Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>So ‘haelende,’ Matt v. 23; ‘haeling’; ‘bodigende,’
Matt. x. 35; ‘bodung,’ Luke xi. 32.</p>

<p>‘Waere þu to-daeg, on huntunge?’ (not <i>huntende</i>)
(wert thou to-day on or in hunting?)&mdash;Aelfric’s Dialogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Hwaet dest þu be þinre huntunge?’ (not <i>huntende</i>)
(what dost thou by thy hunting?)&mdash;Aelfric.</p>

<p>‘<i>The</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CALLING</span> <i>of</i> assemblies I cannot away with.’&mdash;Isa.
i. 13. Not ‘calling assemblies,’ which, if <i>calling</i>
were a mark-word, would mean assemblies that call.</p>

<p>The right speech-trimming with the thing-names in <i><span class="locked">-ing</span></i>
is to trim them in the old English way as thing-names
in their cases; as,</p>

<p>‘We are the <i>offscouring</i> of all things unto this day.’&mdash;1
Cor. iv. 13. Not ‘We are the offscouring all things.’</p>

<p>‘For that righteous man, <span class="smcap lowercase">IN</span> <i>seeing</i> and <i>hearing</i>,
vexed his righteous soul.’</p>

<p>‘By <i>the</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">WASHING</span> <i>of</i> regeneration and (<i>the</i>) <span class="smcap lowercase">RENEWING</span>
<i>of</i> the Holy Ghost.’&mdash;Titus iii. 5. Not ‘He saved us
by the washing regeneration and renewing the Holy
Ghost.’</p>

<p>The ending <i><span class="locked">-er</span></i> of the time-taker (<i>deeder</i>, name-word)
is, not unclearly, the Celtic, Welsh <i>gwr</i>, or in word-welding
<i><span class="locked">-wr</span></i>, the Latin <i><span class="locked">-or</span></i>; as,</p>

<p>
Welsh, <i>barn</i>, doom; <i>barnwr</i>, a doom-man.<br />
Latin, <i>canto</i>, to sing; <i>cantor</i>, a sing-man.<br />
</p>

<p>Thence <i><span class="locked">-er</span></i> seems a far less fitting ending for a tool-name
than the old Saxon <i><span class="locked">-el</span></i>; and a tool for the whetting
of knives would be more fitly called a <i>whettel</i> than a
whetter. <i>Choppel</i>, chopper; <i>clippels</i>, clippers.</p>

<p>All new time-words now taken or shapen from other
tongues must be unmoulded.</p>

<p>We say <i>shoot</i>, shot (not <i>shooted</i>); but <i>loot</i>, looted
(not <i>lot</i>), <i>loot</i> being the Hindustani <i>lootna</i>, to rob or
plunder.</p>

<p>So time-words, which are known English words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of another kind, names or mark-words, are mostly unmoulded.</p>

<p>The shapening of the time-words hangs rather more
on their endings than on their headings.</p>

<p>The oddest are those which end in the throat-pennings&mdash;<b>NG</b>,
<b>NK</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>G</b>; and those ending in roof-pennings&mdash;<b>T</b>,
<b>D</b>.</p>

<p>Because the <i><span class="locked">-d</span></i> of the roof-penning <i><span class="locked">-ed</span></i> is so unlike
a throat-penning, which cannot easily stand with it: and
because the <b>T</b> and <b>D</b> are like <i>d</i> as roof-pennings, and
(<i>see</i> Table) they may run into them.</p>


<h3><b>-ING</b> <span class="smcap">Root-words</span> (strong).</h3>

<p>The wording of a time-taking (predicate) with its
speech-thing (subject) is a <i>Thought-wording</i> (proposition).</p>

<p><i>Strong</i> or <i>moulded time-words</i> are such as, for a
time-taking of foretime, are moulded (without any out-eking)
into another shape or sound, as</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Very many of our time-words are unmoulded from
the same cause&mdash;that they are names of things; although
such names of things, having become worn more or less
out of shape, or having fallen out of use, may not show
themselves to our minds what they are.</p>

<p><i>To hunt</i> makes <i>hunted</i>; why? From <i>hound</i>, to hunt,
meaning at first to seek with a hound.</p>

<p>It may, however, be said, ‘Is to hunt from <i>hound</i>, or
hound from <i>to hunt</i>?’</p>

<p>Such a point is, in very many cases, cleared out by
the Anglo-Saxon, in which ‘to hunt’ is <i>hunt-i-an</i>, not
<i>hunt-an</i>; and the <i>i</i>, a worn shape of <i>ig</i>, shows that
<i>huntian</i> is from <i>hund</i>, hound, and so hound is not from
hunt.</p>

<p>The time-word from the thing <i>hunt-ig-an</i>, <i>hunt-i-an</i>,
is to <i>houndy</i>, to take time with a hound.</p>

<p>We say</p>

<p>But we should say ‘he <i>ringed</i> (not rung) his pig’;
‘he <i>stringed</i> his harp’; <i>ring</i> and <i>string</i> being <i>things</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>strong</i> or <i>moulded time-words</i> are nearly or quite
all words ending in one single breath-penning, and
of a close sound (1, 2, 3, or 4 of the Table), as</p>

<p>Our <i>gh</i> as in <i>taught</i> is the now unuttered (though
still written) throat-penning.</p>

<p>Time-takings or time-givings may be taken as thing-marks,
as ‘the <i>hunting</i> dog’; ‘the <i>hunted</i> hare.’</p>

<p>The sundry moods of time-takings are marked by
sundry shapes of the time-word, or by bye-words or
mark-words&mdash;<i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>must</i>.</p>

<p>The timings of time-takings are marked by sundry
shapes of the time-word, and by bye-words or mark-words
to it, as ‘the bird flies’ or does fly, or flew or did
fly, or will fly.</p>


<h3>Under-Sundrinesses of Time-takings.</h3>

<p>Time-takings are of sundry kinds, under sundry
names, as <i>to be</i>, <i>to walk</i>, <i>to strike</i>.</p>

<p>Under-time-markings may be by single words, as
‘to write <i>well</i> or <i>ill</i>, <i>slowly</i> or <i>quickly</i>’; or by two or
three words, as ‘he runneth <i>very swiftly</i>’; or by clusters
of words, as ‘he runs <i>with most amazing speed</i>’; or ‘he
works <i>in a very skilful way</i>.’</p>


<h3>Fitting of the Time-word to all the cases of
Person, Time, and Mood.</h3>

<p>In this fitting the time-word is helped by sundry
bye-words or under-mark-words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Can</i>, from the Saxon <i>cun-n-an</i>, to ken, know, to know
how. ‘I <i>can</i> write,’ I know how to write.</p>

<p>The heretofore time-shape of <i>Ic can</i> was <i>Ic cuðe</i>, for
which we have now <i>I could</i>, with an <i>l</i> which was never in
the root of the word, and for which there is not any ground.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;<i>Mag-an</i>, the stem of maht, <i>might</i>, means <i>to
strongen</i>, to be or become strong (Lat. <i>valere</i>), as is
shown by cases of its use in Saxon and other Teutonic
tongues.</p>

<p>In an old Friesic good wish at the drinking to the
health of a bride and bridegroom we find ‘Dat se lang
lave en wel mage,’ that they long live and well <i>may</i>
(<i>strongen</i>, <i>bene valeant</i>); and in Saxon, ‘Hu maeg he?’
how mays he? (<i>strongens</i> or <i>valet</i>).</p>

<p><i>Shall.</i>&mdash;<i>Sceal-an</i>, meant, as a stem, to offmark, distinguish,
or to <i>skill</i> in the meaning of 1 Kings v. 6&mdash;‘Ic
sceal dón,’ I offmark or skill to do; as what I am
bent to do.</p>

<p>‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.’ Thou markest
or clearly seest to love the Lord thy God.</p>

<p>‘Thou shalt not steal.’ Thou markest this. Not to
steal.</p>

<p><i>Must.</i>&mdash;<i>Mot-an</i>, <i>most-an</i>, is most likely a stem of the
word <i>mag-an</i>, to strongen (<i>valere</i>).</p>

<p>The <i><span class="locked">-st</span></i> would strengthen the meaning of <i>mag</i> (may)
as it does in <i><span class="locked">-est</span></i> of <i>longest</i>. So ‘I must go’ (Ic moste
gán) would mean ‘I am overmighted by another’s might
to go.’</p>

<p>Time-words are fitted</p>

<p>Single and stringly time-takings of the same name,
as ‘Mary <i>sold</i> me some apples yesterday.’ There was
a single selling; but under the wording ‘Mary formerly
<i>sold</i> apples in the market,’ it is clear that under the same
word <i>sold</i> is meant a string of sellings.</p>

<p>So under the wording ‘<i>Write</i> your name’ is understood
a single writing; but under the wording ‘If you
would write readily, write every day,’ the same word
<i>write</i> implies a string of writings.</p>

<p>Some tongues (as the Greek and Russian) have two
shapes of the time-words for these two cases of time-taking;
as, Greek&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Take thy bill and write fifty’ (γράψον, <i>aorist</i>).&mdash;Luke
xvi. 6.</p>

<p>‘Jesus, stooping down, wrote on the ground’ (ἔγραφεν,
<i>imperfect</i>, ondoing shape, <i>wrote on</i>).</p>

<p>But Acts xxv. 26, ‘About whom I have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
certain to write’ (γράψαι, <i>aorist</i>, to write off once
for all).</p>

<p>See the Greek text of the 3rd Epistle of John v. 13&mdash;‘I
had many (things or many times?) to <i>write</i> (γράφειν,
ondoing shape), but I will not with pen and ink <i>write</i>
(γράψαι) to thee’ (<i>aorist</i>, offdoing form).</p>

<p>An understanding of the difference between the
<i>aorist</i> and ondoing shapes is of weight in the reading
of the Gospel. ‘To <i>make intercession</i>, to <i>intercede</i>
for them.’&mdash;Heb. vii. 25. To intercede once for
all, at the doom-day? No. To intercede on always; for
the word is not in the <i>aorist</i> shape, but in the present
ondoing form, <i>to be interceding</i>.</p>


<h4>Historic Time-wording.</h4>

<p>A time-shape of a time-word used in an unwonted
way for the telling of a string of deeds, as, in English,
the present time-shape is so used for deeds of foretime,
as ‘He <i>opens</i> the door, <i>walks</i> in, coolly <i>takes</i> a chair,
<i>sits</i> down, and <i>tells</i> the maid he wishes to see me.’</p>

<p>So ‘Philip <i>findeth</i> Nathanael, and <i>saith</i> unto him,’
&amp;c.&mdash;John i. 45.</p>


<h4>The Moods of Time-takings.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Mood.</span></h5>

<p>The wording of the time-taking may be; as,</p>

<p>(1) Now or heretofore true, or hereafter sure, as
‘He <i>is</i>, or <i>was</i>, or <i>will be</i>’; ‘He <i>sings</i>, or <i>sang</i>, or <i>will
sing</i>.’ <i>The Truth Mood.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) That it may or can, or could or might be so
taken, as ‘He may or can go.’ <i>The Mayly Mood.</i></p>

<p>(3) Or that it is to be wished that it may or might be
taken, as ‘I wish,’ or ‘Oh that I could go.’ <i>The Wish
Mood.</i></p>

<p>Or that it is a hinge time-taking on which another
hangs, as ‘If you ask (hinge), you will receive (on-hang).’</p>

<p>Or as bidden to be taken, as ‘Go thy way.’</p>


<h4>Stead-marks and Way-marks of Time-takings.</h4>


<h5><span class="smcap">Case.</span></h5>

<p>Things named in speech, so as to mark the stead
of the beginning or end, or of the way of the time-taking
at any point of its length or outreach in time
or room, are Case-things.</p>

<p>There are, however, two cases which are speech-cases
and not stead-marks or way-marks:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That of the of-spoken thing (nominative), the
thing of which the speech speaks, as ‘The bird flies’;
and</p>

<p>(2) The to-spoken thing (vocative), as ‘O sing,
sweet bird.’</p>

<p>Cases are marked by shapes of thing-names or by
case-words, or by the setting of the case-word either
after or before the time-word, as ‘The dog drove out the
cat,’ where the dog is the beginning of the time-taking;
or ‘The cat drove out the dog,’ where the dog is the end
of it, and is shown to be so by the setting of its name
after the time-word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h6><i>Source.</i></h6>

<p>‘The bird flew from, or off, or out of the <i>tree</i>.’</p>

<p>‘He died of or from <i>intemperance</i>.’</p>

<p>The <i>tree</i> and <i>intemperance</i> are source-marks of <i>flew</i>
and <i>died</i>.</p>


<h6><i>End or Aim.</i></h6>

<p>‘John loved <i>George</i>.’</p>

<p>‘He went to or towards <i>London</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Edwin worked for <i>wages</i>, or strolled along by the
<i>stream</i>.’</p>


<h6><i>The Stead Case.</i></h6>

<p>‘John was in the <i>field</i> or at the <i>church</i>.’</p>


<h6><i>The Tool.</i></h6>

<p>‘Alfred wrote with a <i>pen</i>.’</p>

<p>‘The bird flew before, behind, over, under, above,
below, by, around, or through the <i>gate-turret</i>,’ which is
the way-mark of <i>flew</i>.</p>

<p>There is a Source-mark which is a source of the
time-taking, not as being only that thing, but as being a
thing then in some shape or kind of time-taking.</p>

<p>‘(<i>a</i>) The wind being against us, (<i>b</i>) we made but
little way.’ <i>a</i> is the source of <i>b</i>, ‘we made but little
way,’ not from the wind simply as wind, but as also being
against us.</p>

<p>‘You being my leader, I shall overcome.’</p>

<p>This is commonly called the absolute case (allfree
case); though the wind is not free of a time-taking
(being against us). It may be called the ‘thing-so-being’
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Some tongues mark many of the cases by sundry
endings of the thing-name, but we have in common
names only one ending for case, the possessive, as ‘the
horse’s mane,’ ‘John’s house.’</p>

<p>In name-tokens we have three case-forms, as <i>thou</i>,
<i>thy</i>, <i>thee</i>&mdash;<i>thy</i> for the possessive, and <i>thee</i> for all the
other cases.</p>

<p>‘The bird flew <i>from</i> the apple-tree <i>in</i> the corner <i>of</i>
the garden, <i>through</i> the archway, and <i>under</i> the elm <i>by</i>
the barn, <i>round</i> the hayrick, and on <i>over</i> the stream just
<i>below</i> the willow, and <i>above</i> the bridge, and then <i>to</i> the
stall, and on <i>towards</i> the wood, and <i>into</i> an ivy-bush.’</p>

<p>Here the sundry named things are way-marks which
mark the place of the <i>flying</i> in its beginning and end,
and at sundry points of its length.</p>

<p>Such stead-marks or way-marks may be taken as in
either of one or two or three cases, as they may be either
stead-marks or way-marks, and as their beholdingness to
the time-taking may be reckoned to it or from it to
themselves.</p>

<p>‘The bird flew <i>over</i> or <i>under</i> or <i>by</i> the tree.’ The
flying at first reached on nearer towards the tree, and then
reached off again farther from it, so that the tree was at
first in the case of a toness, and then in the case of a
fromness, with the flying.</p>

<p>But under the wording ‘the roof is <i>over</i> the floor,’ or
‘the floor is <i>under</i> the roof,’ the time-taking <i>is</i> is a staid
and not an ongoing one, and either the roof or the floor
may be in the fromness or toness case, as the height
may be reckoned from it to the other, or to it from the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>A housemother may say ‘We live near (<i>to</i>) Fairton’
(toness case); yet an hour afterwards she may say ‘We
live too far <i>from</i> Fairton (fromness case) to step in
readily for errands.’</p>

<p>Her abode may be four miles from Fairton, so that
the time-taking <i>live</i> is as far from Fairton in one case
as the other; and yet it puts it in two sundry cases.</p>

<p>‘If Alfred gave to Edred a field,’ the time-taking <i>gave</i>
ended in the mid-thing, the field (the endingness case),
but it put the field to Edred, as his, in the toness case.</p>

<p>The place of a time-taking may be shown by one
place-mark, or by two or three, of which a latter may
mark the place of a former, as ‘The rooks build <i>in</i> the
elms, <i>above</i> the house,’ where the elms mark the place of
the <i>building</i>, and the house marks that of the place-mark
(the <i>elms</i>).</p>

<p>But some case-words are made up of a smaller
case-word and a thing-name, as ‘Alfred sat <i>beside</i> the
wall.’ <i>Beside</i> being ‘by the <i>side</i>,’ and the side of the
wall (whereof case).</p>

<p>The figure for <i>case-shifting</i>, or the changing of the
case-tokens, is called in Gr. <i>enallage</i> as</p>

<p>‘I have ten sovereigns <i>in my purse</i>’; ‘<i>My purse</i>
contains ten sovereigns.’</p>

<p>‘<i>The pump has</i> a new handle’; ‘There is a new
handle <i>to the pump</i>.’</p>

<p>‘The carpet <i>in</i> the hall’; ‘The carpet <i>of</i> the hall.’</p>

<p>‘The brother <i>of</i> or <i>to</i> that lady.’</p>

<p>‘John <i>likes</i> cricket or is <i>fond of</i> cricket.’</p>

<p>‘Greedy <i>of</i> gain or <i>for</i> gain.’</p>

<p>‘Think <i>of</i> me or <i>on</i> me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>‘He was killed by a blow <i>of a club</i> or <i>with a club</i>.’</p>

<p>‘He spoke <i>in</i> the balcony or <i>from</i> the balcony.’</p>


<h3>THOUGHT-WORDING, SPEECH-WORDING,</h3>

<p>is the setting of words or a bewording of thought or
speech (syntax).</p>

<p>A thought-wording (proposition) is a bewording of
the case of a thing with its time-taking. ‘The boy is
good’ or ‘the boy plays.’</p>

<p>A thought-wording may have more thing-names and
time-words, as ‘The boys and girls read and play.’</p>

<p>Thought-wordings (propositions) may be linked together
in sundry ways, though mostly by Link-words
(conjunctions). ‘Men walk <i>and</i> birds fly’; ‘I sought
him, <i>but</i> I found him not’; ‘I waited at the door <i>while</i>
Alfred went into the house.’</p>


<h4>Twin Time-takings.</h4>

<p>The <i>Hinge</i> Time-taking, on which the other hangs,
and the <i>Hank</i> Time-taking which hangs on the Hinge
one, as ‘If ye ask (<i>hinge</i>), ye shall receive (<i>hank</i>).’</p>

<p>There are sundry kinds of hinge time-takings, as one
or the other or both of the time-takings may or may not
be trowed or true or sure.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Hinge</i> and <i>hank</i>, trowed&mdash;‘As ye ask (as I trow
you do), so ye receive (I trow).’</p>

<p>(2) <i>Hinge</i>, untrowed; <i>hank</i>, trowed&mdash;‘If ye ask (I
trow not whether ye will or no), then ye will receive
(I trow).’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The hinge-word put down as trowedly untrue, and
the hank one trowed, as ‘If ye asked (as I trow you
do not), ye would receive (I trow)’; or ‘If ye had asked
(ye have not), ye would have received (I trow).’</p>

<p>The hinge time-taking trowed, and the other untrowed,
as ‘Ye ask (I trow), that ye may receive (I
trow not that ye will).’</p>


<h4>Speech-trimming.</h4>

<p>The putting of speech into trim; <i>trim</i> being a truly
good form or state. To <i>trim</i> a shrub, a bonnet, or a
boat, is to put it into trim.</p>

<p>1. The first care in speech-trimming is that we should
use words which give most clearly the meanings and
thoughts of our mind, though it is not likely that
unclear thought will find a clear outwording; and either
of the two, as clear or unclear, helps to clearen or bemuddle
the other.</p>

<p>With most English minds, and with all who have not
learned the building of Latin and Greek words, English
ones may be used with fewer mistakes of meaning than
would words from those tongues; though Englishmen
should get a clearer insight into English word-building
ere they could hope to keep English words to their true
sundriness of meaning.</p>

<p>The so-seeming miswordings (solœcisms) of writers
in the Latinised and Greekish speech-trimming are not
uncommon or unmarkworthy.</p>

<p>One man writes of something which <i>necessitates</i>
another, though Latin itself has no <i>necessito</i> to back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
‘necessitate’; another gives <i>eliminate</i> as meaning <i>elicit</i>,
or outdraw; a third calls a <i>failure</i> of a rule an <i>exception</i>
from it. There is no <span class="smcap lowercase">EXCEPTION</span> to a rule but that which
is <i>excepted</i> from it at and in the downlaying of it. If a
man gives a simple rule ‘that if it rains on St. Swithin’s
day it rains forty days after it,’ and it did not so rain
last year, the case is a <i>breach</i> or <i>failure</i> of the rule, and
not an <i>exception</i> to it. He gave no exception.</p>

<p>Some say ‘Mrs. A. has had <i>twins</i>’ or ‘Alfred was
one of <i>twins</i>.’ A twin is a <i>twain</i>, a <i>two</i>, or a couple of
things of the same name or kind; and twins of children
must be at least four. I should say ‘Alfred was one of
<i>a</i> twin.’ In the latter case it would be correct to say
‘There <span class="smcap lowercase">IS</span> <i>one</i> or a <i>twain</i> of fat men,’ &amp;c., in which <i>is</i>
would match both.</p>

<p>One has written ‘ideas are <i>manufactured</i>.’ By whose
hands? Another talks of ‘a <i>dilapidated</i> dress’; and a
third has ‘found the stomach of a big fish <i>dilapidated</i>.’
What are <i>lapides</i>? and what means <i>delapido</i>?</p>

<p>A man has written of an old Tartar that he was ‘a
<i>tameless</i> gorilla’&mdash;a gorilla without a <i>tame</i>! as if <i>tame</i>
were a thing-name.</p>

<p>Another says ‘It imposed <i>absolute limits</i> upon the
choice of positions.’ What are <i>absolute limits</i> if absolute
(from <i>absolvo</i>, to offloosen) means offloosened from
all check and all limits?</p>

<p>A man writes of ‘a photograph reproduced by a new
permanent process.’ Is it the process or the sunprint
that is permanent?</p>

<p><i>Preposterous</i>, foreaft, as when what should be <i>præ</i>,
foremost, is put <i>post</i> or behind; whereas a writer gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a structure as ‘preposterously overgrown,’ as if ‘preposterous’
meant only very much, vastly.</p>

<p>One takes <i>irretrievable</i> as nohow amended. If ‘retrieve’
is the French <i>retrouver</i> (to find again), ‘irretrievable’
would mean not to be found again; and ‘the irretrievable
defeat of the whole nation’ would be one which they
could not <i>find</i> again, as most likely they would not wish
to find it.</p>


<h4>Twy-meanings.</h4>

<p>From want of words in English, or of care, our
wording may seem to bear two meanings, as ‘John
played with Edwin, and broke his bat.’ The bat of
which boy?</p>

<p>‘One Robert Bone of Antony shot at a little bird
sitting upon his cow’s back, and killed it&mdash;the bird
(I mean), not the cowe.’&mdash;<i>Carew.</i></p>


<h4>Word-sameness (Synonyms).</h4>

<p>Words of the same meaning are less often so than
they are so called; and we sometimes give lists of
synonyms showing the differences of their meanings.</p>

<p>A twin of words of one very same meaning is rather
evil than good; and if they are not of one very same
meaning they should not be given as such.</p>

<p>It may be that from a misunderstanding of the word
<i>tautology</i>, as the name of a bad kind of speech-trimming,
men have often shunned the good use of words.</p>

<p>The bad tautology from which speakers have been
so frayed seems to be the giving twice or many times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
within one scope of thought-wording, the same matter
of speech in the same words.</p>

<p>It is true that it would not be good wording to say
‘John has sold <i>John’s</i> horse’ for ‘<i>his</i> horse’ since the
name-tokens are shapen to stand for foregiven names.</p>

<p>But where the same foreused word would give a very
clear&mdash;if not the clearest&mdash;meaning, there seems to be
little ground against the use of it.</p>

<p>‘I bought a horse on Monday and a donkey on
Tuesday, and sold the <i>horse</i> again at a gain on Thursday.’
Why should not the word <i>horse</i> take the latter
place as well as the word <i>steed</i>, or equine animal, or
‘more worthy beast’&mdash;or why should I not as well say,
‘An ass I want, and an ass I will buy,’ as ‘An ass I
want, and a donkey, or <i>it</i> or <i>him</i>, I will buy’?</p>

<p>It seems that much wrong is done to the Greek of
the Gospel by the putting, for the same Greek word,
sundry English ones at sundry passages; and by what
right do we try an Evangelist’s or an Apostle’s wisdom in
the use of the same word, by which he must have meant
to give the same meaning? or why should we make him
to mean by κρίσις, at one time, a trying of a soul, and at
another time a fordooming of him?</p>

<p>It is not any tautology to use near to each other a
thing-name and a mark-word which are only fellow stem-words,
as ‘As <i>free</i>, and not using your <i>freedom</i> for a cloke
of wickedness.’</p>

<p>2. Another care in speech-trimming is the choice of
words for their sound-sweetness (Gr. <i>euphony</i>) or well-soundingness,
or for speech-readiness.</p>

<p><i>Past</i>, with the hissing <i>s</i> with <i>t</i>, is less sound-good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
than <i>after</i>; and <i>aqueduct</i>, with <i>ct</i>, is less well-sounding
than <i>waterlode</i>; nor is <i>cataract</i> softer than <i>waterfall</i>.</p>

<p>The hereunder given wordings were lately heard in a
law court:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I can give you <i>one or two instances</i> of remarkable
intelligence in the cases of fat men’; and</p>

<p>A Juror&mdash;‘There <i>are one or two fat men</i> on the jury
(laughter).’</p>

<p>Dr. K.&mdash;‘I don’t think there are.’</p>

<p>How should these cases be treated? In the first
case, ‘one instances’ is a breach of word-matching, as
would be ‘two instance’; and in the latter, the word <i>one</i>
calls for <i>man</i>, and <i>two</i> for <i>men</i>. May we not better say,
‘I can give you at least one instance,’ or ‘I believe more
instances than one’?</p>

<p>‘A man who has already, and will still, render such
services will be,’ &amp;c. <i>Rendered</i> is understood after <i>has</i>;
but how may the thought be worded without the two
puttings of the word <i>render</i>? Thus: ‘a man who will
still be, as he has already been, found to render,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Penetrate</i> means insink, inpierce. M. Gambetta writes,
‘After the heroic examples given by open towns, and by
villages only guarded by their firemen, it is absolutely
necessary that each town, each commune, shall pay its
debt to the national defence, and that all alike be <i>penetrated</i>
by the task which is imposed upon France.’ It
seems a queer speech-wording to take a <i>task</i> as a thing
that <i>penetrates</i>, though it might be undertaken.</p>

<p>A bad wording is often found with mark-words of the
higher pitch, as ‘Alfred was more clever, but not so
good, <i>as</i> John.’ ‘Not so good’ is an inwedged word-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>cluster,
but the word-setting is bad, as ‘more clever’ calls
for the word <i>than</i>, not <i>as</i>; and ‘so good’ wants <i>as</i>, not
<i>than</i>. It would be better to say ‘Alfred was more
clever, but less good, than John.’ To try the word-setting
take out the wedge-words (‘but not so good’),
and you will have ‘Alfred was more clever <i>as</i> John.’</p>

<p><i>Dislike</i> seems a bad word-shape. <i>Mislike</i> is the old
and true English one. <i>Like</i> is from <i>lic</i>, a shape, as
<i>lich</i>, the body of a dead man. ‘It <i>liketh</i> (licað) me well’
is ‘it <i>shapes</i> itself (looketh) to me well.’ ‘It <i>misliketh</i> me’
is ‘it <i>misshapes</i> itself to me’ (looks bad).</p>

<p>To <i>seem</i> is from the thing-name&mdash;<i>sam</i>, <i>seam</i>, <i>seem</i>,
body or mass&mdash;and ‘it <i>seems</i> to me’ is ‘it <i>bodies</i> itself to
me.’ ‘That ship <i>seems</i> to be a French one,’ or ‘that
man <i>seems</i> to be ill,’ <i>bodies</i> itself or himself to be a French
one or ill.</p>

<p>‘The house and the goods <i>were</i> burnt’; but ‘the
house with the goods <i>was</i> (not <i>were</i>) burnt,’ since it is
only the house that is in the speech-case, as the goods
are in the mate-case. ‘The house <i>was</i> burnt with the
goods.’</p>

<p>‘<i>One</i> of the children <i>are</i> come.’ No&mdash;<i>is</i> come.
The one only is come.</p>

<p>In our taking of time-words from the Latin in the
shape of the past participle, we get at last a queer shape
of word. Take the Latin <i>reg-</i> of <i>rego</i>, to reach or straighten,
as a line, and our word <i>reck</i>. From <i>reg</i> comes <i>regtus</i>,
<i>rectus</i>. Here the <i>t</i> answers to our <i>d</i> (German <i>t</i> of <i>ed</i>
and <i>et</i>). Then <i>rec-t</i> answers to <i>reck’d</i>. Now put on <i>ed</i>
to each, and <i>rec-t</i> becomes <i>rec-t-ed</i>, as in <i>direc-t-ed</i>; and
<i>reck’d</i> becomes <i>reck-d-ed</i>, showing that <i>directed</i> is truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<i>direg-ed-ed</i>, and too like <i>reck-ed-ed</i>, as ‘He <i>reck-ed-ed</i>
nought.’</p>

<p>We may often hear a man who is careful to speak
good English say ‘This rose smells very sweetly,’ for
sweet. The rose smells (gives out smell) as being itself
very sweet, not as smelling (taking in smell) in a sweet
way. To find which to use, the thing-markword or the
under-markword, put ‘<i>as being</i>’ after the time-word, as
‘This rose smells (as being itself) <i>sweet</i>,’ not sweetly.</p>

<p>‘Can you smell now? you had, the other day, lost
your smelling?’ ‘Yes, I smell very <i>nicely</i>.’ Not I smell
as being myself very <i>nice</i>. A rose cannot smell any other
thing, and so cannot smell it <i>nicely</i>.</p>

<p>‘Mary sings very <i>charmingly</i>,’ but ‘Mary looks very
<i>charming</i>.’</p>

<p>‘John looks <i>pale</i>,’ but ‘John looks very <i>narrowly</i>
into that gold-work.’</p>

<p>‘I can taste <i>well</i>,’ ‘That peach tastes <i>good</i>.’</p>

<p>To have seen a man at a bygone time would mean
that the seeing was before that bygone time; but we sometimes
hear a man say, ‘I should (yesterday) have been
very glad to have seen you (if you had called yesterday).’
That is, by wording, ‘I should have been very glad
(yesterday) to have seen you (at a time before yesterday),’
not to see you yesterday; and yet that is what
the speaker means. ‘I should have been very glad
(yesterday) to see you (yesterday),’ or ‘I should be very
glad to-day to have seen you yesterday.’</p>

<p>3. Odd word-shapes are not in the main choice-worthy.</p>

<p>Our time-word <i>go</i> is of unwontsome conjugation, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
its foretime shape <i>went</i> is not shapen from <i>go</i>, but is a
shape of another word, <i>wend</i>.</p>

<p>So the forlessening name, <i>leveret</i> for a <i>hareling</i>, and
<i>cygnet</i> for a <i>swanling</i>, are unwontsome, as being words of
another speech.</p>

<p>4. There is a greater or less freedom of <i>word-shifting</i>
(Gr. <i>anastrophe</i>, up-shifting or back-shifting), as <i>up</i> in
‘Fasten it <i>up</i> well,’ ‘fasten it well <i>up</i>’; or <i>back</i> in ‘He
brought <i>back</i> the saw,’ or ‘he brought the saw <i>back</i>’;
‘There is none to dispute <i>my right</i>,’ or ‘<i>my right</i> there
is none to dispute.’</p>

<p>Why should not English, like other tongues, more
freely form words with headings of case-words, as
<i>downfalls</i>, <i>incomings</i>, <i>offcuttings</i>, <i>outgoings</i>, <i>upflarings</i>, instead
of the awkward falls-down, comings-in, cuttings-off,
goings-out, flare-ups; or <i>offcast</i> (for cast-off) clothes;
or a <i>downbroken</i> (for a broken-down) schoolmaster;
<i>outlock</i> or <i>outlocking</i> (for a lock-out); the <i>uptaking</i> beam
(for the taking-up beam) of an engine?</p>


<h4>Oddly-shapen or Oddly-taken Words.</h4>

<p>Mongrel (hybrid) words, or words partly from one
tongue and partly from another.</p>

<p>Twy-speechwords are a sore blemish to our English,
as they seem to show a scantiness of words which would
be a shame to our minds; as,</p>

<p>
<i>Sub-warder</i> for under-warder.<br />
<i>Pseudo-sailor</i> for sham-sailor.<br />
<i>Ex-king</i> for rodless or crownless king.<br />
<i>Prepaid</i> for forepaid.<br />
<i>Bi-monthly</i> for fortnightly or every fortnight.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>


<h4>Wordiness (Verbosity).</h4>

<p>As ‘The train ran <i>with extraordinary velocity</i>,’ for
‘the train ran <i>very fast</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Alfred did the business <i>with perfect fidelity</i>;’ for
‘Alfred did the business <i>faithfully</i>.’</p>

<p>Thence much of the wordiness of our written, if not
spoken, composition.</p>

<p>The ‘New York Times’ thus explains how it was that
the flames got to the roof in the burning of the Fifth
Avenue Hotel:&mdash;‘Fire always is aspirant, the sole exception
being where incandescent masses fall down, and
so act as a medium of ignition.’</p>

<p>The hard breathing (aspirate) is often wrongly dropped
or misput by less good speakers; but, while the upper
ranks laugh at them for their mistakes, they themselves,
like our brethren of Friesland and Holstein, often drop
it from words to which it of right belongs, and mainly
from the hard-breathed <b>W</b> or the Saxon <b>HW</b> (our
<b>WH</b>).</p>

house-roof’ or ‘<i>injured</i> my flowers’? How can the
behaviour of the wind be made out to be a moral wrong,
even if it be a hurt?</p>

<p><b>Instrumentive</b>, <b>instrumental</b> (case). The <i>tool-case</i>
or <i>means-case</i>, that of the tool or means of a deed; as,
‘He cut the wood with a knife.’</p>

<p><b>Interest</b> (of money). Money-rent, loan-meed, loan-pay.</p>

<p><b>Interest.</b> Care:&mdash;‘I do not take any <i>interest</i> in
him or it.’ ‘I do not becare him or it.’ ‘Wha kara
unsis?’ (what care to us) (Mœso-goth).&mdash;Matt. xxvii. 4.</p>

<p>What a word to be taken as a thing-name is <i>interest</i>,
‘it is of odds’! The folk-speech, ‘It is of no odds to
me,’ gives the meaning of ‘meâ non interest.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Intransitive.</b> Not overgoing, as time-takings that
do not reach forth to another thing; as, to <i>sleep</i>.</p>

<p><b>Inversion.</b> L. <i>inverto</i>, to turn up. An end-shifting:&mdash;‘Thee
at morn, and Thee I praise at night,’ for ‘I praise
Thee at morn, and Thee at night.’ A shifting of the
ends of a wording.</p>

<p><b>Irony.</b> Gr. <i>eirōneia</i>, from <i>eiron</i>, a shammer. A good
wording for a bad meaning, <i>mock-praise</i>; as, ‘That was
a <i>good</i> shot,’ meaning a very <i>bad</i> one. ‘He is a <i>nice</i>
man,’ meaning the reverse of <i>nice</i>. ‘How <i>glorious</i> was
the king of Israel to-day!’ meaning how <i>inglorious</i>.</p>

<p><b>-ism.</b> The stump <i><span class="locked">-ism</span></i> of the Greek <i><span class="locked">-ismos</span></i> seems to
be used very loosely. <i><span class="locked">-ismos</span></i> is from the ending <i><span class="locked">-izō</span></i> of
ontaking or inceptive time-words, and where there is no
time-word ending in <i><span class="locked">-izō</span></i> there is not, I should think,
any thing-name in <i><span class="locked">-ismos</span></i>; as, <i>chloros</i>, green; <i>chlorizō</i>, to
become green; <i>chlorismos</i>, a becoming green. So, if
liberalism is a becoming <i>liberal</i>, conservatism is a becoming
<i>conservat</i>, which might seem to mean <i>conservatus</i>,
one conserved, rather than a conserver. Is chartism a
becoming a <i>chart</i>? and what is Londonism, a becoming
<i>London</i> or a <i>Londoning</i>? and, if so, what is a Londoning?</p>

<p>We have for <i><span class="locked">-ismos</span></i> some English endings, as <i><span class="locked">-ening</span></i>,
in <i>blackening</i>; besides <i><span class="locked">-hood</span></i>, <i><span class="locked">-ship</span></i>, and <i><span class="locked">-ness</span></i>, and many
others of sundry kinds.</p>

<p>For <i><span class="locked">-ism</span></i>, taken in names bestowed with very slight
praise, we may take <i><span class="locked">-ishness</span></i>; as, <i>Hebraism</i>, Hebrewishness;
<i>Grecism</i>, Greekishness; <i>Latinism</i>, Latinishness;
<i>Londonism</i>, Londonishness; <i>solœcism</i>, folkswording. (On
‘Solœcism,’ see Aul. Gell. v. 20.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Iterative</b>. Going over again and again. Iterative
time-words, that mean to take many shorter times in
time-takings of the same kind; as, to <i>chatter</i>, chat
much; <i>clamber, wander</i>.</p>

<p><b>Labial</b> (letter). L. <i>labium</i>, lip. A lip breath-penning.</p>

<p><b>Laxative</b>. Loosensome.</p>

<p><b>Lecture</b>. A lore-speech.</p>

<p><b>Lenis</b>. L. <i>soft</i>. The soft breathing is an <i>unaspirate</i>
one, such as <i>a</i> in <i>and</i>, not <i>ha</i> in <i>hand</i>.</p>

<p><b>Letter</b>. L. <i>litera</i>; Sax. <i>bóc-staf</i>, a book-staff. It is
bad that the same word <i>letter</i> should be used for a <i>letter</i>
of the alphabet and an <i>epistle</i>, the old English word for
which is a <i>brief</i>, as it is in German and West Friesic.
It was also the name of the king’s letter for gathering of
help-money in the church; though now it is the name
only of a barrister’s letter of instruction.</p>

<p><b>Lingual</b>. L. <i>lingua</i>, the tongue. Belonging to the
tongue.</p>

<p><b>Literature</b>. Book-lore.</p>

<p><b>Lithography</b>. Stone-printing.</p>

<p><b>Locative</b> (case). L. <i>locus</i>, stead, place. The stead
or stow-case; as, ‘In London,’ ‘At church.’</p>

<p><b>Logic</b>. Redelore.</p>

<p><b>-m, <span class="locked">-om</span>, <span class="locked">-um</span>.</b> A word-ending, a form of the Greek
one <i><span class="locked">-ma</span></i>, as in <i>prag-ma</i>, from <i>prasso</i>; and of the Latin
<i><span class="locked">-men</span></i>, as in <i>flu-men</i>, from <i>fluo</i>. Words so ended
meant mostly the outcome of the time-word, and
were at first thing-names; and so as time-words they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were, as most of them yet are, weak ones. From roots
ending, I believe, in <i><span class="locked">-ing</span></i> came<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><b>Paragraph.</b> An offwriting, a wording-share; such
a share of a piece of writing as, if it were offwritten,
would not want anything of a full meaning.</p>

<p><b>Paraphrase.</b> New bewording; a turning of a piece
of writing into other words, often more if not clearer
than those of the writer. A paraphrase, while it is meant
to clearen, may falsen the paraphrased matter. The
following paraphrase from an old written sermon of (as
I believe) an old Dorset divine, may be a good sample of
new bewording:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘God, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men
are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
Publican: I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all
that I possess.’</p>

<p>Expanded or paraphrased:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘With great gratitude, O God (said the Pharisee), I
contemplate my own superior attainments. How free
is my mind from a variety of black offences which invade
the consciences of others! Extortion, injustice, and
adultery are crimes (said he, striking his breast) which
have no harbour here. Who can lay to my charge the
neglect of any religious duty? Are not my tithes paid
with cheerfulness, and my fasts observed with sanctity?’</p>

<p>‘And the Publican, standing afar off, would not lift
up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon
his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.’</p>

<p>‘The Publican, on the other hand, with every mark
of the deepest contrition, stood abashed in a corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the temple. Conscious of his own demerits, he was
afraid to raise his eyes to that Being who sees the least
degree of impurity with offence. After many ineffectual
struggles to form the sighing of a contrite heart into the
language of prayer, his efforts ended in this one exclamation,
God be merciful to me a sinner.’</p>

<p><b>Parenthesis.</b> An inwedging of a sentence within
another:&mdash;‘Thou sayest&mdash;but they are but vain words&mdash;I
have strength for the war.’</p>

<p><b>Parody.</b> A song-mocking.</p>

<p><b>Paronomasia.</b> A kind of play on words of more or
less like sound, though of sundry meaning; as, ‘Though
<i>last</i> not <i>least</i>.’ ‘Non amissi sed præmissi’ (said of
friends deceased), ‘Not forgone but foregone.’</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Paronomasia is found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pairs of words of some like sound.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Participle.</b> A thing-marking shape of the time-word.</p>

<p><b>Particle.</b> A wordling, a small shapefast word.</p>

<p><b>Patronymic.</b> Gr. <i>pater</i>, father, and <i>onoma</i>, name. A
surname or sirename of a man taken from the forename
of his father; as, John Richardson, Dafydd Ap-hoel,
Patrick Mac-Duff, Jeroboam Ben-Nebat.</p>

<p><b>Pedigree.</b> Kin-stem, forekin-stem.</p>

<p><b>Penultimate.</b> Last but one.</p>

<p><b>Perambulator</b> (the child’s carriage). Push-wainling.</p>

<p><b><a id="Period"></a>Period</b>, in rhetoric (redecraft) and speechcraft, is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
called, as a speech-ring or speech-round, a full round of
thought-wording, in which the speech-meaning is kept
uphanging and more or less unclear, till the last word
or word-cluster by which it is clearly fulfilled; as,
‘(1) That among the sundry changes of the world (2),
(3) our hearts may surely there be fixed (4): (5) where
true joys are to be found (6).’ The whole thought-wording
is a period or speech-round. From (1) to (4)
is a limb (called in Greek a <i>kōlon</i>) and has a meaning,
though not a full one beyond which the mind awaits
nothing more. The word-cluster from (1) to (2) yields
no full meaning, and is called in Greek a <i>komma</i> (<i>kopma</i>),
a cutting or shareling. Thence we see the source of the
names and uses of the stops&mdash;the <i>period</i> (.), <i>colon</i> (:),
<i>comma</i> (,). The <i>period</i> marked the end of the period;
the <i>colon</i> that of the kolon; and the <i>comma</i> that of a
comma, or cutting of a colon.</p>

<p>The word seems to be often misused. A <i>period</i> (Gr.
<i>periodos</i>) of time or wording is rightly a running of it
round again to its like beginning; as, a week&mdash;from
Sunday round to Sunday; or a year&mdash;from January to
January.</p>

<p>A straight stretch of time or words is not truly a
period; as, a man’s life from birth to manhood is not
a ring-gate, beginning anew at childhood.</p>

<p><b>Periphrasis.</b> Gr. <i>peri</i>, round; <i>phrasis</i>, a speaking.
A roundabout speaking of a thing instead of an outright
naming of it, a <i>name-hinting</i>; as, ‘The gentleman
at the head of Her Majesty’s Government’ for Lord B.</p>

<p><b>Personal</b> (time-word); not an impersonal one; as, ‘It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rains.’ ‘It snows;’ but one with a named time-taker, as
‘John rides.’</p>

<p><b>Philology.</b> Speechlore.</p>

<p><b>Phonetic.</b> Soundly.</p>

<p><b>Phonography</b>, <b>phonotypy</b>. Sound-spelling. Surely
a photograph should be a phototype. <i>Graphō</i> is to
graze or grave along a body, but a photograph is given
by a plumb downstriking of rays of light&mdash;a <i>typē</i> and
not a <i>graphē</i>. With <i>graphē</i> and <i>typē</i> we may set a <i>glyphē</i>
(from <i>glyphō</i>), an outsmoothing of a shape, as that of
a figure from a block of stone. <i>Glyphō</i> is a fellow stem-word
to <i>glykys</i>, smooth, soft, or sweet.</p>

<p><b>Phrase.</b> Gr. <i>phrazo</i>, to speak, say. A word-cluster,
a word-set, a cluster or set of byhanging words.</p>

<p><b>Pirate.</b> Sea-robber, weeking, wyking, wicing (Gloss.
11 cent.). The <i>wicings</i> or <i>weekings</i> or <i>vicings</i> were so
called as lurking about in the bays, <i>wicas</i>, <i>weeks</i>, <i>wykes</i>,
or <i>wiches</i>.</p>

<p><b>Plagiary.</b> A thought-pilferer.</p>

<p><b>Pleonasm.</b> Gr. <i>pleonazo</i>, to fullen or overfullen. An
overwording; as, ‘A great [thing of a] boar’ for ‘a
great boar.’ ‘What [ever in the world] are you doing?’
‘Never [in all my whole life] have I seen the like.’</p>

(from <i>resilio</i>, to spring back) is neither in sound nor
meaning a better word than <i>outcome</i> or <i>outworking</i> or
<i>froming</i>, <i>fromming</i>.</p>

<p><b>Rhetoric.</b> Rede-speech.</p>

<p><b>Rhythm.</b> Gr. <i>rhythmos</i>, number, as number of clippings
or sounds in a line of verse. <i>Metre</i>, which
meant at first tale of sounds rather than sound matching,
which we call rime. <i>Rime</i> is not come to us from
the Greek, but is the Saxon <i>rim</i> or <i>hrim</i>, tale or number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Solœcisms.</b> Gr. <i>soloikismos</i>, from the bad Greek
of the <i>Soloikoi</i> in <i>Cilicia</i>. A miswording, barbarism, or,
as an old Saxon gives it, ‘a miscweðen word,’ or a misquothing,
a misqueathing.</p>

<p><b>-some.</b> The ending <i><span class="locked">-some</span></i> in such words as <i>aimsome</i>,
<i>matchsome</i>, <i>yieldsome</i> seems, as we look to its true first
meaning, to be a fitting one. A <i>sam</i> or <i>som</i> (some)
meant at first a body of mingled matter or things. In
its stronger meaning lumps of suet melted up into a
soft body would be a <i>sam</i> or <i>som</i>; and potatoes boiled
and mashed up would be a <i>sam</i>; and dough, if not flour
itself, is a <i>sam</i> or <i>som</i>.</p>

<p>In the wider meaning of the word an upgathering of
things, and even men, into a body or set is a <i>sam</i> or <i>som</i>.
Thence we have our word <i>same</i> as well as the ending
<i><span class="locked">-some</span></i> and the markword <i>some</i>:&mdash;‘<i>Some</i> in rags, and <i>some</i>
in jags, and <i>some</i> in silken gowns’ (a <i>set</i> or body in rags,
a <i>set</i> or body in jags, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><i>Aimsome</i>, <i>yieldsome</i> would mean of the <i>aim</i> or <i>yield</i>
or <i>aiming</i> or <i>yielding</i> set or body.</p>

<p><i>Sam</i> or <i>som</i> gives our words <i>same</i> and <i>so</i>. ‘The
<i>same</i> man’ means the very man in <i>sam</i> or body or
being. ‘Are they Hebrews? <i>so</i> (same) am I.’ Of that
<i>sam</i> (am I). The Latin <i>se</i> is most likely a word of the
same root:&mdash;‘Lucius <i>se</i> amat’ (Lucius loves <i>same</i> or his
<i>sam</i>); and this is the meaning of our word <i>self</i>.</p>

<p>The Latin <i>similis</i> would mean of the <i>sam</i> or <i>same</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
kind; and ‘to <i>summon</i> (<i>samen</i>) men’ is to call them up

(Gospel), ‘the good message.’</p>

<p><b>Syllepsis.</b> Gr. <i>syn</i>, up, together; <i>lēpsis</i>, a taking.

‘conticuere‿omnes’&mdash;uttering the <i>e</i> and <i>om</i> in the time

An outtaking or outculling, as of a share of a thing for
the whole, or the matter for the thing; as, ‘a hundred
heads’ for ‘a hundred men’; ‘twenty hands’ for ‘twenty
workmen’; ‘a cricketer’s willow’ for his ‘bat.’</p>

<p><b>Synonym.</b> Gr. <i>syn</i>, together; <i>onyma</i> a name.
Synonyms are words or names of the same meaning,
twin-words; as, <i>rabbit</i> and <i>coney</i>, <i>volume</i> and <i>tome</i>,
<i>yearly</i> and <i>annual</i>, <i>letter</i> and <i>epistle</i>. Twains of words
are, however, less often synonyms than they are so
called.</p>

<p><b>Syntax.</b> Speech-trimming. A <i>trim</i> is a fully right
or good state of a thing, the state in which it ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be; and ‘to trim’ a thing is to put it in trim, or fully as
it ought to be. ‘To <i>trim</i> a boat,’ to set it as it ought to
be&mdash;upright, not heeling. ‘To <i>trim</i> a bonnet or dress,’
to put it fully as it ought to be. And so ‘to <i>trim</i> a
hedge’: a man may think that, because much of the
trimming of a hedge is done by cutting, a trimming is
therefore a cutting. ‘I am out of <i>trim</i>’; ‘to <i>trim</i>,’ as
a man in politics, albeit it may not be to set himself
morally as he ought to be, is to set himself as he thinks
that he ought to be for the nonce.</p>

<p><b>Upmating.</b> The upmating of the persons, called
in Greek <i>syllepsis</i>, touches the use of the personal
pronouns. A second or third person upmated with the
first is reckoned as first, and a third upmated with the
second is reckoned as second; as,</p>

<p>‘That boat belongs to my brother (3) and me (1).
<i>We</i> (1) bought it.’</p>

<p>‘That is known only to you (2) and me (1). <i>We</i>
know it.’</p>

<p>‘I saw you (2) and your brother (3). <i>You</i> (2) were
there.’</p>

<p>But persons are upmated as well from kindliness or
civility as from the calls of speech-craft. Thus a
speaker will often upmate himself with a hearer or
another, as a mother may upmate herself with her child
by <i>we</i>, instead of <i>thou</i> or <i>you</i>; as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here <i>we</i> go up, up, up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here <i>we</i> go down, down, downy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here <i>we</i> go backward and forward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here <i>we</i> go round, round, roundy&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>though the going is only that of the child.</p>

<p>A young man may say to a girl friend, ‘How proud
<i>we</i> are,’ meaning ‘<i>you</i> are’; or a man may say of others
who might not be very brisk at work, ‘<i>We</i> are not very
strong to-day’; or a footman may upmate himself with
the heads of the house with such wording as ‘<i>We</i> do
not treat our guests so unhandsomely.’</p>

<p><b>Vocative</b> (case). L. <i>voco</i>, to call. The call-case.</p>

<p><b>-y</b>, <b>-ig</b> (an ending). It means eked with something:&mdash;<i>Snowy</i>,
with snow; <i>dirty</i>, with dirt.</p>

<p><b>Zeugma.</b> Gr., a yoking. A yoking of two things
as to one time-word which would fit only one of them,
another being outleft; as, ‘The house which my own

<i>bought</i> after ‘money.’</p>

<h3 class="break">The Power of the Word-endings.</h3>

<p>Some of the small word-endings end themselves with
a dead breath-penning, and others with a half-penning.
The dead pennings seem to betoken, mostly, an ending,
or shortening, or lessening, in time or shape; while the
half-pennings do not seem to bound, or shorten, or lessen,
the meaning of their body-words.</p>


<h4><i>Dead Pennings.</i></h4>

<p><b>-ock.</b> Hill-ock.</p>

<p><b>-ed.</b> I walk-ed (the time-taking ended).</p>

<p><b>-ig</b>, now <b>-y</b>. Wind-ig, wind-y (an eking of wind).</p>

<p><b>-op</b>, <b>-p</b>; <b>-ob</b>, <b>-b</b>. Flap, flip, a quick flying; heap,
hop, hip, small highenings, or humps; pop out, to poke
out quickly; clap the hands, to close them quickly;
stub, a small stump; wallop, to wallow or well (roll) lightly,
and so as water from a spring, or in boiling. We may
think that we have two very fine words in <i>envelope</i> and
<i>develope</i>, whereas they seem to be nothing better than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Teutonic <i>inwallop</i> and <i>unwallop</i>, to roll in and unroll.
With <i>wallow</i> set the Latin <i>volvo</i> (walwo), to roll.</p>

<p><b>-t</b>, <b>-et</b>. Forlessens.</p>


<div class="lefttable">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Poke,</td><td>pocket.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ball,</td><td>bullet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sock,</td><td>socket.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<h4><i>Half-Pennings.</i></h4>

<p>do not so strongly, if at all, betoken endingness, or
shortness, or smallness.</p>

<p><b>-m.</b> A <i>stem</i> is of any length, but <i>stump</i> is short.</p>

<p><b>-en</b>, <b>-n</b>. <i>Golden</i>, eked wholly in gold; <i>blacken</i>, to eke
on freely in blackness.</p>

<p><b>-ing</b>, as in <i>walking</i>, does not betoken any ending or
shortening of a time-taking.</p>

<p><b>-er</b>, <b>-r</b>, betokens eking out much in shape or time,
as:&mdash;</p>


<div class="lefttable">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Chat,</td><td>chatter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pat,</td><td>patter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Clate,</td><td>clatter.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It so happens that while we have a dead penning, <i><span class="locked">-ed</span></i>,
for the ended time-taking, as, ‘he walked,’ we have a half-penning
for the ongoing time-taking, as, ‘he walketh.’ It
is true that <i><span class="locked">-en</span></i>, a half-penning, is put for <i><span class="locked">-ed</span></i>, as an ending
of some mark-time words, as <i>brok-en</i>, and that <i><span class="locked">-el</span></i>, <i><span class="locked">-l</span></i>,
a half-penning, may seem to mean either much or small,
as <i>prate</i>, <i>prattle</i> (prat-el). Time-words with these endings
in full length are weak.</p>


<ul><li>Bloss-om-ed,</li>
<li>Black-en-ed,</li>
<li>Wall-op-ed,</li>
<li>Chat-er-ed,</li>
<li>Flitt-er-ed,</li>
<li>Pock-et-ed,</li>
<li>Prat-el-ed</li>
<li>(prattled).</li></ul>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><b>s</b> strengthens the meaning of some root-heads, as:&mdash;</p>


<div class="lefttable">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>Melt,</td><td>smelt.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nip,</td><td>snip.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Plunge,</td><td>splunge.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Queeze,</td><td>squeeze.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>So, as an ending of the somely thing-name, it stretches its
meaning from that of one to some ones, as <i>a hand</i>,
<i>hands</i>&mdash;hands being more than a hand.</p>

<p>In the word-ending <b>-st</b> of <i>black-est</i>, the half-penning
<i>s</i> freely forstrengthens <i>black</i>, and the dead-penning <i>t</i>
seems to check its force, so that <i>blackest</i> means <i>black</i>
strengthened, though not unboundedly so, but blackest
of all the things taken with it.</p>

<p><i><span class="locked">-st</span></i> has, I suppose, this meaning also as an ending
of thing-names or time-words, as ‘to <i>boast</i>,’ the meaning
of which is betokened by some other tongues to be to
<i>bow</i> out much the breast or fore-body, the token of
pride and boasting, as it is so often shown to our sight.</p>

<p><i>Bogan</i>, to bow (Anglo-Saxon and Friesic), means ‘to
boast.’</p>

<p>Friesic&mdash;‘Thi mâgy <i>bogade</i> uppa sinra snôdhed.’
(The mâgy boasted (bowed) on his cunning.)&mdash;<i>Oera
Linda Book.</i></p>

<p>‘Hia <i>bogath</i> ìmmer over geda êwa.’ (They boast
(bow) ever over good laws.)&mdash;<i>Oera Linda Book.</i></p>

<p>The old British bard, Llywarch Hên, had in mind the
same token of pride:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;gnawd dyn<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>(It is common for a proud (or boasting) man to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bow- or bulge-breasted); and in the Holderness (Yorkshire)
folkspeech they say ‘as <i>bug</i> (proud) as a dog wi’
two tails,’ and yet, to show that <i>bug</i> means a bow or
bowedness, they say ‘as <i>bug</i> as a cheese.’</p>


<h3>The Goodness of a Speech.</h3>

<p>The goodness of a speech should be sought in its
clearness to the hearing and mind, clearness of its breath-sounds,
and clearness of meaning in its words; in its
fulness of words for all the things and time-takings which
come, with all their sundrinesses, under the minds of men
of the speech, in their common life; in sound-sweetness
to the ear, and glibness to the tongue. As to fulness, the
speech of men who know thoroughly the making of its
words may be fullened from its own roots and stems, quite
as far as has been fullened Greek or German, so that they
would seldom feel a stronger want of a foreign word than
was felt by those men who, having the words <i>rail</i> and <i>way</i>,
made the word <i>railway</i> instead of calling it <i>chemin de fer</i>,
or, going to the Latin, <i>via ferrea</i>, or than Englishmen
felt with <i>steam</i> and <i>boat</i>, to go to the Greeks for the
name of the <i>steamboat</i>, for which Greek had no name at
all. The fulness of English has not risen at the rate of
the inbringing of words from other tongues, since many
new words have only put out as many old ones, as:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>I have before me more than one hundred and fifty so
taken English law-words which were brought into the
English courts with the Norman French tongue; but
English speech did not therefore become richer by so
many words, because most of them thrust aside English
ones. <i>Judge</i> took the stead of <i>dema</i>; <i>cause</i> of <i>sác</i>; <i>bail</i>
of <i>borh</i>; and the lawyers said <i>arson</i> for <i>forburning</i>;
<i>burglary</i>, for <i>housebreach</i>; and <i>carrucate</i>, for <i>ploughland</i>;
and King Alfred gave to English minds the matter of
Gregory’s Pastoral with a greater share (nearly all) of
pure English words, than most English scholars could
now find for it.</p>

<p>On clearness, it is to be feared that, notwithstanding
the English may be clear in breath-sounds to the ear,
there is often a want of clearness to the mind from the
many pairs of words which have worn into the same
sound, such as:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>and others; and from the use of Latin and Greek and
other foreign words, which are used in other than their
true first meanings, or the meanings of which the common
folk do not understand.</p>

<p><i>Teleology</i> is a word which I have just seen in a Dorset
paper, as for the matter of a lately given lore-speech,
‘the examination or the discussion of the purposes for
which things are created.’ Now, in English the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
<i>end</i> means both a <i>forending</i>, or termination, and a purpose;
but I do not think that <i>telos</i> (end) or <i>teleosis</i>, in
Greek, means a purpose. <i>Prothesis</i> would most likely have
been put for it by a Greek.</p>

<p>The Latinish and Greekish wording is a hindrance to
the teaching of the homely poor, or at least the landfolk.
It is not clear to them, and some of them say of a
clergyman that his Latinised preaching is too high for
them, and seldom seek the church.</p>

<p><i>Swan</i> is a clue to the meaning of <i>swanling</i> but none
of <i>cygnet</i>; and if a man knew that <i>kyknos</i> was the Greek
for swan he might still be at a loss for the meaning of <i><span class="locked">-et</span></i>,
which is not a Greek ending.</p>

<p>For sound-sweetness or glibness, we should shun, as
far as we can, the meeting of hard dead breath-pennings
of unlike kinds. We have in our true English too many
of them, and some of them from the dropping of the <i>e</i>
from the word-ending <i><span class="locked">-ed</span></i>, as in <i>slep’t</i> and <i>pack’d</i> (lip and
roof, and throat and roof pennings, and in both cases
hard dead pennings); and then, as if we had not enough
of them, we have brought in a host more of such ones
from the Latin, as in <i>act</i>, <i>tract</i>, <i>inept</i>, <i>rapt</i>.</p>

<p>Now, <i>forbend</i> is a softer-sounded word than <i>deflect</i>,
since <i>ct</i> (kt) are hard throat and root pennings, very unhandy
together, and the <i>n</i> of <i><span class="locked">-nd</span></i> is a mild half-penning,
and <i>d</i> is a mild dead penning. So <i>dapper</i> is better
sounded than <i>adept</i>, since <i>p</i> is a single hard penning
between two free breathings, and <i>pt</i> are a hard lip and a
hard roof breathing, unfollowed by any softer breathing.</p>

<p>It was against such harshness of hard unlike breath-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>pennings
that Celtic speech took its markworthy word-moulding.</p>

<p>As a token of the readiness of two kindred breath-pennings
to run into one, we may give the words of the
Liturgy, ‘Make clean our hearts within us,’ for which a
clergyman will hardly, without a pause and a strong
pushing of the breath, help saying ‘Make lean our hearts
within us.’</p>

<p>There came out in print some time ago a statement
wonderful to me, that it had been found that the
poor landfolk of one of our shires had only about two
hundred words in their vocabulary, with a hint that
Dorset rustics were not likely to be more fully worded.
There can be shown to any writer two hundred thing-names,
